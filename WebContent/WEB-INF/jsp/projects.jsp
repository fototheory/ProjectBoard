               <h6>The NU Capstone Project Board is envisioned as a catalysis of knowledge where ideas are put into action through a systematic process within the project board. This process facilitates the interactions between a project sponsor, National University faculty members, and capstone students where well-define projects are posted for students to select and challenge themselves. The overall project management process can be simplified in the following diagram.</h6>

              	1. The sponsor creates a project and lead faculty member is then notified by the project board in a form of a post. </br></br>
 				2. The lead faculty member, after adding academic requirements and man-hours required for the project, assigns a negotiating faculty member to interact with the sponsor to gather both business and technical requirements.</br></br>
 
				3. The negotiating faculty member continues polishing the project requirements in conjunction with the capstone faculty member. Once finalized, the negotiating faculty member posts a complete description of the project for interested students to request participation on it and for capstone faculty members to manage at his discretion.</br></br>
 
				4. Capstone faculty member adjusts the academic requirements at his discretion and guide students on completing the capstone project.</br></br>
 
				5. A student looks at the list of projects and if interested, he or she can request to participate with approval from both the negotiating and capstone faculty members.</br></br>
 
				6. The student teams work with the capstone faculty member primarily and sponsor occasionally to meet the project requirements and deliver the useful product to the sponsor.</br></br>
